If that is not true, and the values are defined in relation to user behavior, then I would have acted differently, if I had been made aware of this. Since I assumed it was \"fair\" I used experiental data (observed range of values by me & cost of node clicking) to calculate my behavior. In the beginning, it seemed to me the revelation cost was quite steep in relation to potential outcome, so I tried to minimize revelations and took first route that seemed proportionally efficient (good enough method). \n",
      "How strategy was improved: During the game I considered, if I were in your shoes designing this, to actually make an unfair game (although I am thinking you might scientifically be in a bit of a bad spot here, if that's the case. i would assume participants have a sort of rightful expectation to not be tricked by the design. i am aware that this is not the case at all, but psychologically, I did end up making this assumption. the reason why i am saying this might put you in a bad spot scientifically, is the following: isn't it a confounding variable if people either suspect or don't suspect that the web maybe really isn't \"fair\" and more of a \"on-the-go\" calculation, based on prior user choices. personally, i may have considered to inquire about prior experience with processes such as this, to perhaps gauge the likelihood people might realize this or not. or, alternatively, you could ask this question after the survey \"do you think the values were determined at the start of the round, or do you think the values were actually not set and only decided once you revealed a node?\" \"would you have behaved differently, had you known the board is not determined, but adaptive?\"). Then I realized, if this is an \"unfair\" game, then you might actually watch me for exploratory behavior after a \"good enough\" route is discovered, a sort of measure of if a person thinks there might be a hidden super-node, if they just keep clicking. In any case, based on thoughts such as this, I decided to enlarge my seeking algorithm a bit, to check if the values are actually not predetermined at the beginning (fair). I had the impression that you are actually rewarding doing a bit of a risk, and thereby doing an unfair game as I defined it, thus I explored a bit further and then took the maximized path, since I had a hunch this behavior might maximize my return. However, I never opened all nodes.\n",
