      "Strategy Used: always click the edge till a positive is found then later till a +48 is found\n",
      "How strategy was improved: Started hunting for 48 as that trumps the 1$ cost\n",
      "Difficulty: It was easy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I selected the nodes at the end to see the value before moving. If the value was negative I selected another node, but if the value was 48, I moved to that node without clicking on other nodes.\n",
      "How strategy was improved: In terms of memorizing the numbers. I created a story using things and people's birthdays. \n",
      "Difficulty: Repeating the sequence became difficult, especially if the nodes were negative numbers. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: Buying nodes was cheap so in theory you could click on all nodes and still profit but i mostly gambled and if i found a +24 or +48 i always went for it and didnt check the other nodes\n",
      "How strategy was improved: Not really\n",
      "Difficulty: It wasnt very difficult. The hardest part was memorizing but i have some good memorization techniques replacing numbers with images in my mind that i learned myself a few years back.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: To be very honest I focussed more on remembering the numbers than anything else.\n",
      "How strategy was improved: No, I was more obsessed with remembering the number sequences.\n",
      "Difficulty: I did not improve because I was focussing on the memory task more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I read the numbers and then repeated them in my mind while trying to figure out the best way in the game.\n",
      "How strategy was improved: Yes, I tried clicking at the furtthest nodes, since most of the time, the way ending with the number 48 would be the best\n",
      "Difficulty: It was a bit challenging because I focused mostly on not forgetting the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I originally clicked on the closest nodes and tried to work out what would be beneficial- sometimes I clicked all the way to the end and sometimes I assumed that if one path ended in -48 dollars, the opposite side would have a positive value (which turned out not always to be right!).\n",
      "How strategy was improved: Once I figured out that the most influential nodes were the furthest away, I only clicked these. I was looking for a 48 dollars and would stop if I found it. \n",
      "Difficulty: I really was distracted by remembering the number sequences!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I repeated the sequence in my head a few times before I moved on to the game. I would try to complete the game as fast as I could while still repeating the numbers in my head. \n",
      "How strategy was improved: Yes, it got easier to keep track of the numbers and I was able to complete the game quickly and use the few seconds I had before entering the number to go over it in my head again.\n",
      "Difficulty: It was not too difficult, but it would have been easier if the game did not have the 7 second play period. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I tried to read the digitals in triplets, used the keyboard to look at the numbers and if there is some kind of pattern\n",
      "How strategy was improved: I think it was the same during the task\n",
      "Difficulty: I was tired at the end \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: I memorised the numbers while moving along the \"web\", I would alternate between moving left to right and up and down. \n",
      "How strategy was improved: No, not necessarily. \n",
      "Difficulty: The overall score per game did impact concentration - particularly if you have received a negative overall score.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy Used: Memorise the numbers and repeat them with each step and the discovery of nodes if I needed to\n",
      "How strategy was improved: At first, I tried my luck to not lose points, but it was a bad idea and I started discovering nodes to come out on top\n",
      "Difficulty: Memorise the arrangement of numbers and do not mix them up when looking at the points in which direction to go\n",
