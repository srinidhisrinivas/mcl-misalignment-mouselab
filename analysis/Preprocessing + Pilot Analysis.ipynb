Since I assumed it was \"fair\" I used experiental data (observed range of values by me & cost of node clicking) to calculate my behavior.

Then I realized, if this is an \"unfair\" game, then you might actually watch me for exploratory behavior after a \"good enough\" route is discovered, a sort of measure of if a person thinks there might be a hidden super-node, if they just keep clicking. In any case, based on thoughts such as this, I decided to enlarge my seeking algorithm a bit, to check if the values are actually not predetermined at the beginning (fair). I had the impression that you are actually rewarding doing a bit of a risk, and thereby doing an unfair game as I defined it, thus I explored a bit further and then took the maximized path, since I had a hunch this behavior might maximize my return.
